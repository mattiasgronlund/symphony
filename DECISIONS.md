# Decision Log

This log records decisions that shape `SPEC.md` (and, later, the implementation). Its purpose is to
preserve the *reasoning* behind each decision so it can be re-evaluated later without re-deriving the
original context.

Each decision is one chapter below: a short heading, a **State**, a link to its folder, and a short
focused prose description. The folder holds the supporting detail:

- `Background.md` — why the decision was made (the reasoning, alternatives, trade-offs).
- `Plan.md` — how the decision is to be implemented in `SPEC.md`.
- `Sessions.md` — the Claude session name(s) and id(s) that worked on the decision.

**States:** `Proposed` (under consideration) · `Accepted` (decided; to be / being applied) ·
`Rejected` (decided against; kept for the record).

New decisions get the next zero-padded number and a folder `decisions/NNNN-short-slug/`. Copy
`decisions/_template/` to start. See `CLAUDE.md` for the working conventions.

## 0001 — Adopt a decision log

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0001-adopt-decision-log/](decisions/0001-adopt-decision-log/)

Keep a structured decision log so changes to `SPEC.md` are traceable to their reasoning. Each
decision is a chapter here plus a folder containing `Background.md`, `Plan.md`, and `Sessions.md`.
This lets us revisit a decision later with its original motivation intact, rather than guessing at
why the spec reads the way it does.

## 0002 — Stable addressing of SPEC.md from decision plans

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0002-stable-spec-addressing/](decisions/0002-stable-spec-addressing/)

`Plan.md` files address `SPEC.md` by stable identity — code-token identifiers first, then section
titles, with section numbers only as a secondary hint — and phrase each step as a declarative,
idempotent post-condition rather than a positional diff. This keeps plans re-executable in any order
and after intervening edits, where line/column or paragraph addressing would degrade. Anchor renames
and removals are recorded append-only in the `Anchor changes` section of the decision that causes
them, rather than in a standalone registry that would duplicate `SPEC.md` and rot.

## 0003 — Responsibility inversion and the credential broker boundary

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0003-responsibility-inversion-credential-broker/](decisions/0003-responsibility-inversion-credential-broker/)

Symphony inverts from a scheduler/tracker-reader where the agent holds credentials into a privileged
broker: it performs all outward side effects (VCS remote operations, pull-request creation, all
tracker interaction) while a sandboxed, credential-less agent supplies only operation content through
a semantic `symphony` CLI over a per-run socket. The boundary enforces scope as well as confidentiality
(push only to the work branch, write only to the assigned issue), brokered results are structured with
a run-fatal `scope_denied`, and secrets resolve through a provider interface and are scrubbed from the
environment before the sandbox forks. This is the keystone for decisions 0004–0009.

## 0004 — Sandbox isolation and the per-run broker socket

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0004-sandbox-isolation-broker-socket/](decisions/0004-sandbox-isolation-broker-socket/)

Each agent run MUST be wrappable in a configurable sandbox, with a strict-by-default profile assumed
(reference baseline: `jai` `Strict`, https://jai.scs.stanford.edu, on Linux; an equivalent mechanism
elsewhere). A per-run socket is the only privileged channel into the sandbox and binds each connection
to one (repo, issue, branch) for scope enforcement; the working tree is bind-mounted from the host so
Symphony runs credentialed git host-side against it. Egress is configurable with a strict default plus
an allowlist. This drops the SSH Worker Extension (Appendix A) for now.

## 0005 — Config and trust split

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0005-config-trust-split/](decisions/0005-config-trust-split/)

Configuration splits on the sandbox boundary: `WORKFLOW.md` (repo-owned, untrusted) holds only settings
used *inside* the sandbox — the prompt and in-sandbox build/test hooks — while a new operator-owned
policy config holds everything Symphony uses outside the sandbox (credentials, scope rules, sandbox
profile, repo map, the workflow state-machine, agent selection, privileged setup hooks). Both surfaces
hot-reload with last-known-good-on-invalid. This retires the "hooks are fully trusted configuration"
assumption.

## 0006 — Agent adapters (Codex, Claude Code)

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0006-agent-adapters/](decisions/0006-agent-adapters/)

Section 10 generalizes into a neutral agent runner contract plus per-agent adapters (Codex, Claude
Code), each deferring to its own protocol; the existing Codex detail becomes the Codex adapter. Agent
selection is operator policy: a per-repo default agent and native (pass-through) effort, overridable
per issue via an explicit policy table mapping tracker labels to (agent, effort) pairs. Session identity
and token accounting are generalized off Codex-specific shapes.

## 0007 — VCS abstraction and git automation

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0007-vcs-abstraction-git-automation/](decisions/0007-vcs-abstraction-git-automation/)

A VCS adapter (GitHub, Forgejo) backs the broker's git and PR verbs. The agent does local git including
`git commit`; Symphony performs clone/fetch/branch/back-merge/push/PR and maintains one PR per issue
(created then updated). The work branch is Symphony-derived and deterministic (`symphony/<identifier>`).
Back-merge is attempted at run start but postponed if it would conflict, with conflict resolution
required only on push-reject via a Symphony-stages / agent-resolves handoff. Commit author and push/PR
actor are configurable per repo.

## 0008 — Tracker abstraction and writes

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0008-tracker-abstraction-writes/](decisions/0008-tracker-abstraction-writes/)

A tracker adapter (Linear, Forgejo) supports reads *and* writes, reversing the spec's "tracker reader
only" boundary. Symphony drives ticket lifecycle via a policy-owned workflow state-machine; the agent
supplies free-text content and emits semantic milestone signals (`ready-for-review`, `blocked`, `done`)
that the state-machine maps to the actual tracker transitions.

## 0009 — Multi-repo and shared polling

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0009-multi-repo-shared-polling/](decisions/0009-multi-repo-shared-polling/)

One Symphony instance manages multiple repositories. Issues are routed to exactly one repo by explicit,
tracker-implementation-specific mappings in policy config (Linear project/team/label/assignee → repo;
Forgejo repo/tags/state → repo), and a single tracker's polling is shared across its repos to minimize
background work. Workspace, concurrency, and the object store/worktrees become keyed by (repo, issue).

## 0010 — State recovery model and class taxonomy

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0010-state-recovery-classification/](decisions/0010-state-recovery-classification/)

The spec's current recovery stance ("without a durable orchestrator DB", "intentionally in-memory") is
an implicit two-class model — every field is either reconstructable from an external source of truth or
reset-and-lossy at startup — with zero durable state. Planned spend-control extensions introduce state
that is neither safely reconstructable nor safely lossy, hinging on the distinction between *account
totals* (external, account-wide, intermittently reachable) and *Symphony-attributed totals* (internal,
must be correct). This decision makes the taxonomy explicit and adds a per-field classification
obligation over four classes: `Reconstructable` (R, never primary-persisted), `Ephemeral` (E, documents
its reset consequence), `Cached external signal` (C, last-known-good plus an explicit `UNKNOWN` sentinel
that is never `0`, with a configurable fail-open/closed policy), and `Durable` (D, idempotent
re-seed-before-enforcement accounting). It admits D as the narrow, OPTIONAL exception to the
no-durable-DB stance, reclassifies `codex_rate_limits` to C, and is the shared prerequisite for
decisions 0011–0013.

## 0011 — Per-execution durable ledger

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0011-execution-ledger/](decisions/0011-execution-ledger/)

An append-only, per-execution usage ledger keyed by `(issue_identifier, session_id)`, recording absolute
token snapshots and summarized by a high-water mark per session (then summed) so repeated appends are
idempotent. It is both the per-execution history surface (audit, debugging expensive/looping runs, cost
attribution) and the RECOMMENDED realization of class-D durability from 0010 — while D's contract stays
abstract so a non-ledger durable counter still conforms. Observability-first (no cost/`model` field in
the core schema), with non-fatal I/O. OPTIONAL extension; realizes the existing Section 18.2 TODO on
persisting session metadata across restarts.

## 0012 — Token budget guards

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0012-token-budget-guards/](decisions/0012-token-budget-guards/)

Token-unit budget enforcement as an OPTIONAL extension and an application of class D (0010). Per-session
and per-issue caps abort and requeue the single issue; a global cap pauses new dispatch while in-flight
runs continue (a dispatch gate composing with Section 8.3). Budget exhaustion is its own failure
category (`token_budget_exceeded`) routed to a park/blocked state and kept out of the Section 8.4
retry/backoff path. Counters are durable and re-seeded idempotently before enforcement (closing the
fresh-budget-on-restart gap), with an OPTIONAL soft warning threshold and an OPTIONAL constrained
one-shot recovery. A cost/currency pricing overlay is explicitly deferred.

## 0013 — Provider quota backpressure

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0013-quota-backpressure/](decisions/0013-quota-backpressure/)

Activates the currently-inert `codex_rate_limits` tracking into a normalized provider-quota snapshot
(comparable `used_percent`, opaque buckets, staleness, optional error) governed by class C (0010), fed
by either an in-band rate-limit stream or an OPTIONAL out-of-band poller. A dispatch-only gate pauses new
work when any bucket crosses a threshold, leaving running agents untouched, with implicit resume and a
configurable fail-open/closed policy on `UNKNOWN` (unsupported defaults open; transient block MAY close).
Account-wide headroom is kept separate from Symphony-attributed spend (0012). OPTIONAL extension.

## 0014 — Turn and step terminology

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0014-turn-step-terminology/](decisions/0014-turn-step-terminology/)

Disambiguates two things colloquially called a "turn". Keeps `turn` meaning the orchestration-
initiated prompt-to-completion cycle on the live agent thread (unchanged, aligned with the Codex
app-server protocol's turn unit and `turn_id`), and introduces `step` for the coding agent's
internal, autonomous tool-call iteration within a turn — agent-internal, neither initiated nor
counted by Symphony, so `max_turns` bounds turns, not steps. (An adapter MAY still cap steps with a
native limit such as `--max-turns`, distinct from `agent.max_turns`.) The outer tier remains the
`run` (Section 7.2): a run contains turns, a turn contains steps. Rejected the inverse (turn = inner loop,
rename the cycle) as a conflict with the protocol the spec defers to.

## 0015 — Neutral agent runner contract

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0015-neutral-agent-runner-contract/](decisions/0015-neutral-agent-runner-contract/)

Elaborates decision 0006's thin agent contract into a turn-centric, transport-neutral one, informed by a
study of ~24 backend-swap forks. Replaces the implicit "keep the subprocess alive across continuation
turns" assumption with an explicit, opaque, adapter-owned `continuation_ref` (a persistent app-server
becomes one adapter whose ref is a warm handle; a per-invocation CLI another whose ref is a resume token
or declares non-resumable). Adds a REQUIRED `cancel` with RECOMMENDED interrupt-then-drain to a resumable
state (making timeouts and early stops clean boundaries, per 0014's Identione refinement); REQUIRES neutral
events and a neutral token-usage record `{input_tokens, output_tokens, total_tokens}` with opaque extras;
advertises adapter capability as a static descriptor (resume mode, native step cap, accepted effort) rather
than a method; and rules that an adapter encapsulates one (agent, transport) pairing and MUST NOT
impersonate another agent's protocol. Selection (0006) and the broker (0003/0004) are unchanged; the
`codex_*` observability-field rename is delegated to a follow-on sweep (0016).

## 0016 — Neutralize agent observability vocabulary

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0016-neutralize-agent-vocabulary/](decisions/0016-neutralize-agent-vocabulary/)

The mechanical-but-cross-cutting sweep deferred by 0006 and enabled by 0015: renames the persisted and
emitted `codex_*` observability vocabulary to neutral names every adapter normalizes into — bare inside the agent-session struct (Section 4.1.6),
scope-qualified in the runtime map (Section 4.1.8). `codex_app_server_pid` -> `pid`, `last_codex_*` ->
`last_*`, `codex_{input,output,total}_tokens`
-> `{input,output,total}_tokens`, `codex_totals` -> `agent_totals`, `codex_rate_limits` ->
`provider_rate_limits`, `codex_update` / `Codex Update Event` -> `agent_update` / `Agent Update Event`,
`codex_session_logs` -> `agent_session_logs`, plus neutralizing Codex-worded hardening prose (Section
15.5). Genuinely Codex-adapter-specific anchors (the `codex` config block, the Sections 10.1-10.8 worked
example, `codex.command`) are intentionally left unchanged. The generic-timeouts-under-`codex.*` config
wart is left for a separate decision.

## 0017 — Workflow transition graph

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0017-workflow-transition-graph/](decisions/0017-workflow-transition-graph/)

Refines decision 0008 after the 22-fork tracker sweep found its flat milestone map (`tracker.milestones`)
unattested and Section 11.6 over-claiming a state-machine it never specified. The workflow state-machine
becomes an explicit directed graph over tracker workflow-state names: transitions `{from, on, to}` keyed on
one closed trigger vocabulary that unifies agent-emitted milestone signals (`ready-for-review`, `blocked`,
`done`) and orchestrator-observed run outcomes (`dispatched`, `pull_request_opened`, `run_succeeded`,
`run_failed`, `retries_exhausted`, each tied to Section 7.2/7.3). The graph lives in `tracker.transitions`,
replacing `tracker.milestones`; an unmatched trigger transitions nothing and the graph MUST be
deterministic. Nodes reuse existing state names rather than introducing a `stage` noun; provider
representation of states and tracker write-capability are deferred to a later capability decision.

## 0018 — Tracker capability descriptor

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0018-tracker-capability-descriptor/](decisions/0018-tracker-capability-descriptor/)

Acts on the 22-fork sweep's biggest finding: Section 11.1's "every adapter MUST support all six operations"
is false for writes. The three reads stay REQUIRED; the writes (`add_comment`, `set_state`,
`link_pull_request`) become capability-gated. Each tracker adapter advertises a static capability descriptor
(data, not a runtime call) mirroring the agent adapter (Section 10.9 / decision 0015); the orchestrator
reads it before a write and at preflight. An undeclared write yields `tracker_unsupported_operation` and an
unsupported write MUST NOT be silently no-oped or replaced by a synthesized substitute. A non-empty
`tracker.transitions` (decision 0017) requires the `set_state` capability. Normalized-Issue field
optionality and provider state representation are out of scope.

## 0019 — Neutralize tracker error vocabulary

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0019-neutralize-tracker-error-vocabulary/](decisions/0019-neutralize-tracker-error-vocabulary/)

The tracker-side mirror of decision 0016 (agent `codex_*` neutralization): renames Section 11.4's
Linear-named error categories to transport-neutral `tracker_*` names — `linear_api_request` ->
`tracker_api_request`, `linear_api_status` -> `tracker_api_status`, `linear_graphql_errors` ->
`tracker_backend_errors`, `linear_unknown_payload` -> `tracker_payload_invalid`,
`linear_missing_end_cursor` -> `tracker_pagination_error` — and records the Linear GraphQL adapter's mapping
onto them as a `Note:`. The Section 17.3 error-mapping test row is neutralized to match. The retired
`linear_graphql` tool name and the `~/.linear_api_key` example path are genuinely Linear-specific and
unchanged.

## 0020 — Normalized issue metadata and optional fields

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0020-normalized-issue-metadata/](decisions/0020-normalized-issue-metadata/)

Acts on the sweep's normalized-model findings: the flat `Issue` (Section 4.1.1) silently drops provider
fields the flat schema does not capture, and `branch_name`/`blocked_by` are Linear-isms that no-op on other
trackers. Adds an opaque, adapter-owned `metadata` map to `Issue` as the documented escape hatch (an adapter
MAY round-trip a provider write handle through it, e.g. a GitHub Projects v2 item id, instead of re-resolving
per write), and marks `branch_name` and `blocked_by` OPTIONAL/tracker-dependent — an adapter without a
dependency model leaves `blocked_by` empty and blocker-gated dispatch (Section 8.2) then does not gate.
Section 11.3 records the Linear-specific derivation and an `Implementation-defined` `metadata`. Stops short
of a WorkItem wrapper to stay surgical.
