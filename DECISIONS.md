# Decision Log

This log records decisions that shape `SPEC.md` (and, later, the implementation). Its purpose is to
preserve the *reasoning* behind each decision so it can be re-evaluated later without re-deriving the
original context.

Each decision is one chapter below: a short heading, a **State**, a link to its folder, and a short
focused prose description. The folder holds the supporting detail:

- `Background.md` — why the decision was made (the reasoning, alternatives, trade-offs).
- `Plan.md` — how the decision is to be implemented in `SPEC.md`.
- `Sessions.md` — the Claude session name(s) and id(s) that worked on the decision.

**States:** `Proposed` (under consideration) · `Accepted` (decided; to be / being applied) ·
`Rejected` (decided against; kept for the record).

New decisions get the next zero-padded number and a folder `decisions/NNNN-short-slug/`. Copy
`decisions/_template/` to start. See `CLAUDE.md` for the working conventions.

## 0001 — Adopt a decision log

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0001-adopt-decision-log/](decisions/0001-adopt-decision-log/)

Keep a structured decision log so changes to `SPEC.md` are traceable to their reasoning. Each
decision is a chapter here plus a folder containing `Background.md`, `Plan.md`, and `Sessions.md`.
This lets us revisit a decision later with its original motivation intact, rather than guessing at
why the spec reads the way it does.

## 0002 — Stable addressing of SPEC.md from decision plans

**State:** Accepted
**Folder:** [decisions/0002-stable-spec-addressing/](decisions/0002-stable-spec-addressing/)

`Plan.md` files address `SPEC.md` by stable identity — code-token identifiers first, then section
titles, with section numbers only as a secondary hint — and phrase each step as a declarative,
idempotent post-condition rather than a positional diff. This keeps plans re-executable in any order
and after intervening edits, where line/column or paragraph addressing would degrade. Anchor renames
and removals are recorded append-only in the `Anchor changes` section of the decision that causes
them, rather than in a standalone registry that would duplicate `SPEC.md` and rot.
